# Development of PSEC

This document is intended to the developers of PSEC.

## Requirements

This section describes the requirements for building a development computer.

- PSEC uses `python 3` for the core services and scripts.
- An [Alpine build environment](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_up_the_build_environment_on_HDD) must be prepared.

## Build the packages

The steps for building the packages are:
- `git clone` the project.
- Enter each source folder in the `setup` directory.
- Run `abuild checksum && abuild -r`.

The packages will be available in the folder `~/packages/psec/<arch>`.

### psec-alpine-iso

This package creates a modified ISO for the HVM DomU in a system running PSEC. It is a dependency for `psec-core`. 

It compiles the Linux kernel and adds modules needed in `sys-usb` and `sys-gui`, then it creates the ISO image used when booting the DomU.

*The compilation of the kernel is a very long process (multiple hours)*.
