# Documentation

Prerequisites : Install the dependencies by running `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

The documentation can be generated in a python virtual environment by running the command `$ poetry run make html`. This must be ran in the folder `python/lib/docs` and in a virtual environment where the dependencies are available.
