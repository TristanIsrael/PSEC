class Api(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    """ 
    This class allows a third-party program to send commands or receive notifications without needing to use the socket directly.

    The API provides a simple set of instructions for sending commands and receiving notifications. However, it does not handle the formatting of commands, which is managed by the RequestFactory, ResponseFactory, or NotificationFactory classes.

    The API can only be used within a user domain (Domain).

    To use the API, simply instantiate the Api class and open the socket by calling the start() function. Then, the other functions allow for sending and receiving messages and notifications.

    Asynchronous
    ============

    All commands operate asynchronously. The result of executing a command will only be communicated through a notification or a response. Therefore, a callback function must be provided to the API in order to receive responses. The internal topics
    provided in the :class:`Topics` use the suffix `/request` and `/response` to differenciate the query and the answer. When an answer is expected on a topic, it will always be suffixed with `/response`.

    **The callbacks are**:
    - API is ready  (see :func:`Api.add_ready_callback`)
    - Message received  (see :func:`Api.add_message_callback`)
    - The broker acknowledged a subscription (see :func:`Api.add_subscription_callback`)

    Subscription
    ============

    **The messages and notifications can be received only when the following conditions are met:**

    - The topic has been subscribed (see :func:`Api.subscribe`)
    - A message callback function has been provided (see :func:`Api.add_message_callback`)

    How to use the API
    ==================

    The sequence to correctly handle the connection and subscriptions on a broker is the following:
        1. start
        2. on ready
            - subscribe
        3. on subscribed
            - continue the app

    Here is an example:

            event.wait()

        def on_connected():
            Api().add_subscription_callback(on_subscribed)
            Api().add_message_callback(self.on_message_received)
            success, mid = Api().subscribe(<topic name>)
            if success:
                subscriptions.append(mid)

        result to be provided.

        Please also consider using a **lazy-loading** strategy which minimizes the load on the system
